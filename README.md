# IPTP-paper-code: Inverse Problems in Turing Patterns

## Code for the paper: "Unraveling biochemical spatial patterns: machine learning approaches to the inverse problem of Turing patterns"
## Setup

* Tested on Mac OS Ventura 13.3.1(a) and Rocky Linux

* Requirements:\
  Python 3.9.16\
  Tensorflow 2.11.0\
  Numpy 1.22.1\
  Maptlotlib \
  SciPy 1.9.3 \

## Structure of code

Code is divided in three main files: 

* The `Least_Squares.py` file contains all code involving the Least Squares method and plots for the figures in the paper. 

* The `RBF_PINNs.py` file contains all code involving the RBF-PINNs method applied to the PDE models discussed in the paper (Schnakenberg, FitzHugh-Nagumo and Brusselator) and plots for the figures. 

* The `RBF_PINNs_ChemPat.py` file contains all code involving the RBF-PINNs method applied to the chemical patterns and plots for the figures.
